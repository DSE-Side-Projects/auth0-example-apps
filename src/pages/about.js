          <p>
            In order to simplify deployment of sample apps, we create
            individual apps from Auth0
            {' '}
            <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts">Quickstarts</a>
            ,
            Guides, Tutorials and blog posts. We deploy each individual app
            with
            <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>
            {' '}
            with
            {' '}
            <i>netlify deploy --prod</i>
            , set DNS to point to the app, and add
            app&apos;s information to
            <a href="https://sanity.io">Sanity.io</a>

            instance we also deploy for this project. With all this said and
            done, we have our main site showcase all the apps we have
            deployed.

            One of the main features here is a single-button deployment and

            hosting.
            It&apos;s perfect for single-page apps and static websites. For apps

          <h3>DSE Sample Apps Site</h3>
          <p>
            The main site is powered by
            {' '}
            <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>
            , built on
            {' '}
            <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby Cloud</a>
            {' '}
            on every commit
            and whenever any data is updated in our Sanity database. The build
            is then deployed to
            <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>
            {' '}
            and
            usually is up and running at
            {' '}
            <a href="https://dse.netlify.app">dse.netlify.app</a>
            {' '}
            within 1-2
            minutes. This CI/CD pipeline is already setup and doesn&apos;t require
            any tweaking at this time.
          </p>
          <h3>Sample Apps</h3>
          <p>
            Each sample app lives in it&apos;s own folder within this project.
            These folders are ignored by Netlify deployment pipeline. Whenever
            a change made to one of the apps, we manually deploy this app with
            {' '}
            <i>netlify deploy --prod</i>
            {' '}
            (or
            <i>netlify deploy</i>

              Netlify CLI
            </a>
            ). When these changes are committed, no new builds will happen
            (unless there&apos;s an update to the main DSE Sample Apps site)
          </p>
          <h3>Fun</h3>
          <p>
            Netlify makes a screenshot of every site they deploy, and these
            screenshots are available through
            {' '}
            <a href="https://open-api.netlify.com/">Netlify API</a>
            . To make
            things fun, we fetch these screenshots for each sample app as a
            post-build Netlify hook. This hook calls a serverless function
            (learn more about
            {' '}
            <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/">
              Netlify Functions

            ) which retrieves the latest site screenshot, sends it to
            {' '}
            <a href="https://kraken.io">Kraken.io</a>
            {' '}
            for resizing and

            the
            resulting optimized image to our Sanity DB. As a result, our apps
            are always represented with the most current screenshot. Almost
            none of this actually works yet, but hey, work in progress,
            remember?
          </p>
          <h3>Auth0</h3>
          We are using
          {' '}
          <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>
          {' '}
          for
          authentication and authorization (surprise!). Eventually, Auth0 DSEs
          will be able to tweak certain parameters of the apps they wish to
          single-click deploy. They will also be able to modify tenant
          parameters right from the app and export `yaml` right away.
